          The experience of reading online has become distracting. The amount of
          buttons and popups in every platform, from blogs to news sites, is
          frustrating for users. <br />

          While looking for the ideal space for my blog, I decided that I wanted
          a clean and non-intrusive platform. With a focus on legibility and
          free of interruptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this was my second time designing and building a website, I
          had to learn and research the technical aspects of what I wanted to
          do. Having a clear concept in mind made the process simpler. <br />

          My timeline was three weeks.

          Sketches and wireframes I started by recognizing the basics elements:
          body of text, title, date and navigation. <br />
          I'm a big fan of pencil and paper, sketching by hand allows me to
          think free of constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the mid-fi wireframes, I organized the elements and negative
          space was one of my priorities.

          The titles narrative in the home page was a fun part of this project.
          Linking the ideas together is a fun way to show that my writing is
          always about the same topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blue dot as a back button is one of my favorite things for this
          project. It was hard to do while I figured out what was possible but
          very rewarding at the end.

          I’ll set another deadline for myself and change a few of the things I
          need to work on: design a 404 page for my “next” section, a few people
          have reach out to me telling me the link is broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a simple and challenging project that served as a
          consolidation of what I learned in HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing a project in public was helpful for accountability. Testing my
          skills in private is one thing, publishing means I need to pay
          attention to every single detail: from code to visuals.
