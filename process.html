    <h3>Current project</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="twopg">
    <p>My main project is a dating app that connects people based on their interests.</p>
    <p><i>Started July 2020 <br> Last updated August 2020 </i></p>
 </div> 
    <div class="subtitle">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    </div>
   <div class="twopg">
    <p>I want to combine the best aspects of existing dating services but with another focus: <b>connections based on interests and emotional wellbeing.</b></p>
    <p>Users will be able to <b> discover and connect</b> with compatible people, based on the music they like, their taste in movies, their hobbies or what was the last book they read.</p> 
    <p>They will be able to start a conversation based on something they already have in common and share content on their profiles.</p> 
    <p>My personal goal is to deliver a <b>functional prototype</b> and create a complete visual design.</p> 
  </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
    <h3>UX research</h3>
    </div>
   <div class="twopg">
    <p>I started by having <b>casual conversations</b> about dating and taking notes on them. This was an entertaining way to test my assumptions, to learn new things and <b>understand what people think</b>  about dating apps in a less structured way.</p> 
    <p> I <b>organized and highlighted</b> my notes, making it easier to <b> scan for information</b> and focusing on what was important for my research.</p> 
    <p>Red was for negative impressions or worries, green was for positives, blue was for the feelings and how the usual dating app makes people feel and yellow was for relevant information. My main questions were:</p>  
    <p>What is surprising or unexpected information about dating apps? <br>
      What are the most <b>important aspects of connecting online?</b></p>

   </div>
 <div class="twopg">
  <p>With this survey, I highlighted the important information and compared to what I learned from my casual research.</p>
  <p>After seeing the responses, I realized some of the questions <b>were biased</b>. The fact that the question #9 had a big number of 4 and 5 responses meant that it wasn't well phrased, who doesn't want to have a good conversation?.</p> 
    
  <p>The phrasing was: "While connecting online, I'd rather have a good conversation than a big number of connections". I will rephrase giving multiple options to choose from about what is important for each person.  
    It wasn’t possible to change them at this point, so I decided to advance on the project and make a new survey later on.</p>
  <p>Using what I learned, I'm sure I'm going to be able to <b>make better questions</b> and understand my goals better.

    <h3>What's next?</h3>
    </div>
   <div class="twopg">
 
  <p>I decided to use a <b>different approach</b> to personas, I’m focusing on single people with hobbies and defined interests. Without demographics in mind. This will make my process more focused in creating connections, regardless of gender.</p>
  <p>I’m currently working on three user flows: onboarding, messaging and a general flow.</p>  
  <p>I’ll start making lo-fi wireframes and sketching basic functionalities and features.</p>
