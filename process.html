    <h3>Current project</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="onepg">
    <p>My main personal project is a dating app that connects people based on their interests.</p>
    <p><i>Started July 2020 <br> Last updated August 2020 </i></p>
 </div> 
    <div class="subtitle">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    </div>
   <div class="onepg">
    <p>I want to combine the best aspects of existing dating services but with another focus: <b>connections based on interests and emotional wellbeing.</b></p>
    <p>Users will be able to <b> discover and connect</b> with compatible people, based on the music they like, their taste in movies, their hobbies or what was the last book they read.</p> 
    <p>They will be able to start a conversation based on something they already have in common and share content on their profiles.</p> 
    <p>My personal goal is to deliver a <b>functional prototype</b> and create a complete visual design.</p> 
  </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
    <h3>Research</h3>
    </div>
   <div class="onepg">
    <p>I started by having <b>casual conversations</b> about dating and taking notes on them. This was an entertaining way to test my assumptions, to learn new things and <b>understand what people think</b>  about dating apps in a less structured way.</p> 
    <p> I organized my notes and highlighted with color codes, making it easier to <b> scan for information</b> and focusing on what was important for my research. My main questions were:</p>  
    <p>What is surprising or unexpected information about dating apps? <br>
      What are the most <b>important aspects of connecting online?</b></p>
   </div>
 <div class="onepg">
  <p>With this survey, I highlighted the important information and compared to what I learned from my casual research.</p>
  <p>After seeing the responses, I realized some of the questions <b>were biased</b>. It wasn’t possible to change them at this point, so I decided to advance on the project and make a new survey later on.</p>
  <p>Using what I learned, I'm sure I'm going to be able to <b>make better questions</b> and understand my goals better.</p>
   
    </div>
    <div class="subtitle">
    <h3>What's next?</h3>
    </div>
   <div class="onepg">
 
  <p>I decided to use a <b>different approach </b> to personas, instead of multiple ones, I’m focusing on single people with hobbies and defined interests. Without genders or demographics in mind.</p>
  <p>I’m currently working on three user flows: onboarding, messaging and a general flow.</p>  
  <p>I’ll start making lo-fi wireframes and sketching basic functionalities and features.</p>
