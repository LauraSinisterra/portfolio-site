    <p>This is an <b>experimental</b> page. A way to show what I'm currently working on and my process in personal projects. I want this to be a <b>dynamic portfolio</b> site.<br>
At the moment, my main personal project is a dating app that connects people based on their interests. <br>
<i>Updated august 2020 </i>

    <p>I want to combine the best aspects of existing dating services but with another focus: <b>connections based on interests and emotional wellbeing.</b>
    </p>
     <p>
        Users will be able to <b> discover and connect</b> with compatible people, based on the music they like, their taste in movies, their hobbies or what was the last book they read.
    </p> 
    <p>         
        They will be able to start a conversation based on something they already have in common and share content on their profiles.
    </p> 
    <p>
        My personal goal is to deliver a <b>functional prototype</b> and create a complete visual design. 
    </p>

    <p> <b>Research</b><br> I started by having <b>casual conversations</b> about dating and taking notes on them. This was an entertaining way to test my assumptions, to learn new things and <b>understand what people think</b>  about dating apps in a less structured way. 
    </p> 
    <p>
I organized my notes and highlighted with color codes, making it easier to <b> scan for information</b> and focusing on what was important for my research. My main questions were:
    </p>  
    <p>
What is surprising or unexpected information about dating apps? <br>
What are the most <b>important aspects of connecting online?</b>
    </p>
   </div>
<img src="img/da-3.jpg" alt=''>
<div class="prtext">
  <p> <b>Survey</b><br> With this survey, I highlighted the important information and compared to what I learned from my casual research.
  </p>
   <p>After seeing the responses, I realized some of the questions <b>were biased</b>. It wasn’t possible to change them at this point, so I decided to advance on the project and make a new survey later on.<br>Using what I learned, I'm sure I'm going to be able to <b>make better questions</b> and understand my goals better.
  </p> 
  <p> <b>What’s next?</b><br>
    I decided to use a <b>different approach </b> to personas, instead of multiple ones, I’m focusing on single people with hobbies and defined interests. Without genders or demographics in mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m currently working on three user flows: onboarding, messaging and a general flow.
  </p>  
     <p>
        I’ll start making lo-fi wireframes and sketching basic functionalities and features.
