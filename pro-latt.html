          Lattude is an attorney firm specialized in fintech startups. Based in New York, they provide legal and advisory services for financial technology companies at early stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The brief was to reimagine a new visual identity and propose a website that matched their mission. The challenge was to keep it simple, traditional for a law firm and fresh taking into account the existing elements. Proposing minimal changes, to ensure consistency to their existing brand.

        <h2>Identity</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="twopg">
        <p>
          The Lattude wordmark is a contemporary sans serif with a distinctive qualitiy: the brand’s signature joined ‘T’. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Suggesting unity and trust, the joined ‘T’ becomes a strong and recognisable symbol meant to be used accross platforms, for print and digital media.

        <h2>Color system</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="twopg">
        <p>
          The primary Lattude colour palette is made up of blue, green and yellow. Modifying the existing colors with a difference in shades, the proposed color system was closely related to the previous one. The intention was to rely on dark colors, using bright accents.
          <br>
          These colours feature across Lattude branded assets including illustration, type, graphs, printed and digital materials.

      <div class="twopg">
        <p>
          With the brand identity in place, the rebranding of the website intended to elevate the brand and give more white space to the website.
          <br>
          The proposed website changes were not implemented.
