     <h2> Human first. Designer and philosophy undergrad student.<br>

<div class="onepg">
<p>I can say many things about myself. None of them are catchy phrases repeated all over the internet. I like to frame myself in a very honest way. 
    </p>
<p>For an extended version of who I am, I wrote a <a href="https://laurasinisterra.github.io/Blog/user-manual.html" target="_blank">personal user manual.</a>

    <h3>What is this site about</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="onepg">
    <p>
      This site went through many iterations before coming into its actual form. It was a site in potency for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
The ideas were there, I knew them, I also knew something was off. Took me a while to understand that I was doing things for what I thought others were expecting from me. 
Repeating patterns and following guidelines from the 874 million articles about portfolios on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
I'm aware that this is a site for others. But what I'm saying here is not "look at this thing I made for you" what I'm saying is "this is what I do, what I enjoy and how I think". 
    </p>
    <p>
The plurality of my skills and interests move me in a different direction. I'm not saying that is a good direction, I avoid the false dilemma of good vs. bad. I'm still finding what my own direction is.
    </p>
    <p>
So this is a digital space I created for myself. A place for exploration, for finding out what is my design practice about. What I call a proto-folio. 
    </p>
    <p>
It also a place to show my work, my thinking and my design process. Yes, a portfolio. 
    </p>
    <p>
At the end, its main purpose is to find out how can I make that useful for you: reader, potential collaborator, co-creator, employer, co-worker, friend.
