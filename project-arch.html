    <div class="twopg">
      <p>I worked with a team with an industrial design and a civil engineer.
      </p>
        <p> 
     My main work and principal contribution was the layout and the design of the <b>space configurations.</b></p>
     <p>The materiality of the project was based mostly on the <b>local materials</b>: brick and wood, traditional in the region.The goal was not to stand out but blend in, and <b>focus on the interior space dynamics.</b>
     </b>  
     </p>
      <p>
         Because this is a house for an older couple, the accessibility aspect was very important, not for the current moment of construction but for the <b>future.</b>
     </p> 
     <p>         
        The durability aspect of designing architecture demands thinking in the future aspects and in our future self. <b>How are we going to navigate the space when our bodies change?</b> 
       </p>
       <p>         
        My approach to answer this question is to minimize the amount of stairs and prioritize ramps as the main form of vertical circulation inside the house.
