    <p> Undefine (x) is a Toronto based apparel brand for running and cycling.<br>
     The brief was to create a <b>simple, creative, colorful rebranding.</b> 
    </p>
<p>The main challenge was to create a complete new brand aligned with the previous one. This included the creation of a <b>single visual element</b> that can be easily recognizable.
    </p>
 </div>

  <div class="prtext">
    <p> My initial approach was to work with the previous brand name (ubx) as the main element. After sketching a few versions on paper and exploring different fonts, I decided to go with the one with <b>cleaner lines and defined edges.</b>  
    </p>
     <p>
       Because their main product is socks, the logo has to go through a manufacturing process, so the <b>less intricate the better.</b>
    </p> 
    <p>         
     For the single visual element, I added a circle as a way to indicate the idea of going outside the boundaries.
    </p>

  <div class="prtext">
    <p> For the secondary elements, my intention was to convey <b>movement and the active lifestyle</b> the brand embodies, with the use of the elongation and repetition of the main visual element along two axis. 
    </p>   
   </div>

<div class="prtext">
  <p> An interesting and challenging part of the project was to create new design patterns for socks. I created 4 patterns and with them, I made almost 80 iterations of color schemes.
  </p>
   <p>My proposals were not chosen for manufacturing but it was a great exercise. I was able to <b>think about the challenges</b> of moving a design from a two dimensional setting into a three dimensional one.
  </p> 
  
  <p>It was also a great exercise because I learned that I can achieve the same goal (showing my ideas and send them for feedback) if I do three very well thought designs instead of 20. <b>Reducing output, having criteria and being selective is a great skill to have.</b> 
  </p>

<div class="prtext">
  <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>This project was successful as my first big remote design project. It required <b>clear and consistent communication.</b>
  </p>
<p>My priority was to understand exactly what the client wanted, discern when I should ask for clarification, and when I should start working and speak through the design itself. <br>
   I was able to put to the test my <b>time management and organization skills</b> and they were up to the task.
