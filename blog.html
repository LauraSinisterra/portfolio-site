    <p> The experience of reading online has become distracting. <br> The amount of buttons and popups in every platform, from blogs to news sites, is frustrating and discouraging.</p>
<p>While looking for the ideal space for my blog, I decided that I wanted a <b>clean and non-intrusive platform</b>. With a focus on legibility and free of interruptions.</p>
 </div>

  <div class="prtext">
    <p><b>Goal</b><br>Design a <b>reading experience</b> for mobile and desktop. Clean and free of distractions.   
    </p>
     <p>
      <b>Challenges</b><br>Because this was my second time designing and building a website, I had to <b>learn and research</b> the technical aspects of what I wanted to do. Having a clear concept in mind made the process simpler.
    </p> 
    <p>         
     My timeline for this was <b>two weeks</b>, from idea to functional site.

    <p><b>Sketches and wireframes</b></p>
      <p>
      I'm a big fan of pencil and paper, my process always start by sketching by hand. From here, I recognized the basics elements I wanted: body of text, title, date and navigation.  
    </p> 
   <p>With the mid-fi wireframes, I organized my basic functional elements and added subtitles, arrows and lines. </p> 
   </div>

<div class="prtext">
  <p>A fun part of this project was the titles narrative for the home page.
   Linking the ideas together is my way to show that my writing is always about the same topics.
  </p>
   <p>The blue dot as a back button is one of my favorite things for this project. 
     It was hard to do while I figured out what was possible in a technical sense, but very rewarding at the end. In my next update, I'm going to add a small arrow that indicates that is a back button. 
  </p> 
  <p>
    In my next update, I'm also going to change the "next" section. Is not completely clear that is a space for drafts. </p>

  <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>This was a small and challenging project that served as a consolidation of what I've been learning in HTML and CSS.
  </p>
<p>Sharing a project in public was helpful for accountability. Testing my skills in private is easier, publishing is a very different thing. It means I need to pay attention to every single detail: from code to visuals.
