          <p>
          The project is driven by my experience looking for a space for my blog. Reflecting on the limitations of the existing platforms, my approach was to create a clean and non-intrusive platform. With a focus on legibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          While serving a practical function, it was also an exercise of intentional experimentation, to challenge my skills in HTML and CSS after finishing an online course in 2020.

            <h3 class="title">Starting point</h3>
            <p>
              The project started by spending a lot of time browsing through blogging platforms and drawing insights from how they are built and what their main purpose is. In my decision-making process, I decided to place a higher priority to the text, and figure out the best way to translate this into the website user experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I realized that the experience of reading online has become distracting. It is frustrating to navigate the amount of buttons and popups in every platform, from blogs to news sites. I asked myself, what would be the minimal version of a blog website?
            </p>
            <h3 class="title">Sketches and wireframes</h3>
          <p>
          My process always starts with pencil and paper, sketching by hand allows me to think free of technical constraints and get a feel of what the main structure will be. 
          I started by recognizing the basics elements: body of text, title, date and navigation.
          </p>
          <p>
          Because this was my second time designing and building a website, I had to learn and research the technical aspects of what I wanted to do. Having a clear concept in mind made the process simpler.
          </p>
          <p>
          With the mid-fi wireframes, I organized the elements and negative space was one of my priorities. Before moving into the final website, I did prototypes in Codepen to make sure everything was working correctly.

                <h4>Examples of blog posts and longer titles</h4>

        <div class="item9">
        <h3 class="title">Execution</h3>
          <p>
       The title design in the home page makes it easy to find content. Linking the ideas together was a fun way to show a general overview of the content.
        </p>
        <p>
        Chartering new territory, one of the more challenging aspects of the build was the blue dot as a back button. It is also one of my favorite things for this project. It was hard to do while I figured out what was possible but very rewarding to see the end result.
        </p>

        <div class="item1">
          <h3 class="title">End results</h3>
          <p>
        This was a simple yet challenging project that served as a consolidation of what I learned in HTML and CSS at the beginning of 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharing a project in public was helpful for accountability. Testing my skills in private is one thing, publishing means I need to pay attention to every single detail: from code to visuals.
