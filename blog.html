      <p>The experience of reading online has become distracting. The amount of buttons and popups in every platform, from blogs to news sites, is frustrating for users. <br>

        While looking for the ideal space for my blog, I decided that I wanted a clean and non-intrusive platform. With a focus on legibility and free of interruptions.</p>
        <p>
            Because this was my second time designing and building a website, I had to learn and research the technical aspects of what I wanted to do. Having a clear concept in mind made the process simpler. <br>

My timeline was three weeks.

    <p>Sketches and wireframes

        I started by recognizing the basics elements: body of text, title, date and navigation. <br>
        I'm a big fan of pencil and paper, sketching by hand allows me to think free of constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the mid-fi wireframes, I organized the elements and negative space was one of my priorities.

        <p>The titles narrative in the home page was a fun part of this project. 
            Linking the ideas together is a fun way to show that my writing is always about the same topics.                             
        </p>
        <p>
            The blue dot as a back button is one of my favorite things for this project. It was hard to do while I figured out what was possible but very rewarding at the end.

        <p>I’ll set another deadline for myself and change a few of the things I need to work on: design a 404 page for my “next” section, a few people have reach out to me telling me the link is broken.
        </p> 
        <p>This was a simple and challenging project that served as a consolidation of what I learned in HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>Sharing a project in public was helpful for accountability. Testing my skills in private is one thing, publishing means I need to pay attention to every single detail: from code to visuals.</p>
